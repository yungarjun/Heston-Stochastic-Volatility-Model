# Heston-Stochastic-Volatility-Model
A python function that prices vanilla calls/puts via the heston stochastic volatility model. The parameters of this model are then calibrated based on the implied volatility of TSLA options data. 
Where the best choice of Heston model parameters are chosen such that the squared error of the Black/Scholes implied volatilities from the Heston model prices is minimised.
